Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Information Technology at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.en/), Department of Electronics Information and Bioengineering([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page)). My experiences include full-stack web-app development, VR applications, game design.
On the research side I've worked on digital twins, deep learning, wireless/networking systems.

My elevator pitch is: Iâ€™m passionate about building great software, I love deep learning, and I care deeply about performance.
